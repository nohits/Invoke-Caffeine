# Invoke-Caffeine
Caffeine keeps your computer awake and doesn't allow it to sleep or its screensaver to activate.

This script simulates a harmless keystroke in the background every few minutes. This function will not interfere with normal operation.

Once started, the script will run in the system tray, showing as cmd icon. 

Click on the systray icon to access the start, stop, and pause controls.
